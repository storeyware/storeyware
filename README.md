🪄 **Recent Graduate at Davenport University - Computer Science, A.I. Specialization**

As of April 2024, I have completed my B.S. in computer science at Davenport University with a specialization in artificial intelligence. Currently, I'm working alongside various agencies in association with the Cybercorps Scholarship for Service program which began in the classroom, continued with an internship with the Airforce Research Laborator during the summer of 2023, and extends post-graduation as a full-time position in the workforce. My code has a focus on readability, a reflection of my background in illustration and graphic design.
